# PyFlow - Visual Python Coding Assistant (Enhanced)

## üéØ Enhanced Objective

PyFlow helps new Python programmers write, understand, debug and optimize code faster by turning code into interactive visual flowcharts and by **visualizing data-structures & algorithm execution step-by-step**. Users can author code, see control flow, inspect variable & memory state, watch DS mutations (push/pop, insert/delete, rotate, traverse) and compare algorithm behaviours ‚Äî all in one workspace.

## ‚ú® Core Features (Updated)

### 1. Dynamic Code-to-Flowchart Visualizer
- Real-time flowchart generation from Python AST
- Interactive nodes with code line mapping
- Control flow visualization (if/else, loops, functions)

### 2. **NEW: Data Structure & Algorithm Visualizer**
**What it does:**
- Visualizes common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, binary trees, heaps, graphs, tries)
- Shows real-time state changes during code execution
- Visualizes algorithm steps (sorting, searching, traversal, pathfinding, recursion)
- Memory-like view with simulated heap/stack and object references
- Timeline slider with play/pause/step-forward/step-back controls
- **Compare Mode**: Side-by-side algorithm comparison (QuickSort vs MergeSort)
- Clickable visual nodes that map to code lines

**Why it helps:**
- Transforms abstract concepts into concrete, animated visualizations
- Shows measurable metrics (comparisons, swaps, memory allocations)
- Provides intuitive operational model of algorithms and data structures

### 3. Enhanced Interactive Debugging Mode
- Step-by-step execution with DS state updates
- Variable panel shows both primitives and complex structures
- Call stack visualization with recursion frames
- Reverse execution capability
- Memory view with object references

### 4. AI-Powered Learning Assistant (Enhanced)
- **DS/Algorithm explanations**: "At step 5 the node 7 is moved to the right subtree because..."
- **Performance suggestions**: Use deque vs list for O(1) operations
- **Algorithmic complexity analysis** with evidence from execution trace
- Auto-generated DS visualizations from code comments

### 5. Enhanced Template & Snippet Library
- **DS/Algorithm templates**: Linked-list insertion, BFS/DFS, sorting algorithms
- Pre-built visualizations with step-by-step commentary
- Drag-and-drop DS operations

### 6. Advanced Gamified Challenges
- Algorithm visualization testcases
- Performance comparison challenges
- Progressive difficulty with DS complexity
