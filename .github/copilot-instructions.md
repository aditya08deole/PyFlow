# PyFlow Project Instructions

## Project Overview
PyFlow is a Visual Python Coding Assistant website that helps new Python programmers write, understand, debug, and optimize code faster through real-time visual flow diagrams, interactive debugging tools, and AI-assisted coding suggestions.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with Monaco Editor, Mermaid.js/D3.js for flowcharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python backend with AST parsing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes
